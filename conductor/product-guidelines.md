# Product Guidelines: Flow State

## 1. Communication Style
**Technical & Transparent**
We prioritize clarity, technical accuracy, and detailed explanations of how local processing works. This approach is essential to building deep trust with our privacy-conscious user base. We explain *what* data is used, *where* it is stored (locally), and *how* it is processed, avoiding vague marketing jargon in favor of verifiable technical facts.

## 2. Visual Aesthetic
**Organic & Fluid (with Minimalist Foundations)**
Inspired by the "Flow State" name, the interface should feel smooth and modern. We will employ:
*   **Fluidity:** Use gradients and soft transitions to evoke a sense of continuous movement and connection.
*   **Modernity:** Incorporate rounded corners, soft shadows, and a polished, high-quality PWA feel.
*   **Clarity:** While visually rich, the layout will maintain the clean structure of a Modern & Minimalist design to ensure accessibility and usability are not sacrificed for style. The goal is a calming, responsive experience that feels like a native extension of the device.
